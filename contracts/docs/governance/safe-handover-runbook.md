# Safe Multisig Handover — Runbook (live generation)

**Author:** Anton Carlo Santoro
**Scope:** transfer privileged governance of the live Base Sepolia generation from the
deployer EOA to a Gnosis Safe + ProtocolTimelock, and seat the 3-of-5 Claims Committee.

The handover **script already exists** — `script/GovernanceMigration.s.sol` (two-phase). This
runbook documents executing it against the live generation. No code change required.

## Owner prerequisites (not automatable)

1. Create the **protocol Safe** (e.g. 2-of-3 or 3-of-5) on Base Sepolia → `SAFE_ADDRESS`.
2. Create the **Claims Committee Safe** (3-of-5) → `COMMITTEE_SAFE`.
3. Decide the timelock `MIN_DELAY` (≥ 1 hour floor; production typically 24–48h).

## Phase 1 — deploy timelock + grant (deployer keeps roles)

```bash
cd contracts
PROTOCOL_ROLES=0x3e961139Ea0EDA926bfE8f7bfe5022D7AA108192 \
SAFE_ADDRESS=<protocol safe> \
EXECUTOR_ADDRESS=<protocol safe or executor> \
MIN_DELAY=86400 \
WRITE_DEPLOYMENT_JSON=false \
forge script script/GovernanceMigration.s.sol:GovernanceMigration --rpc-url base_sepolia --broadcast
```

Records the new `ProtocolTimelock` address (→ `TIMELOCK_ADDRESS`). OWNER_ROLE +
DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE are now held by BOTH the timelock and the deployer.

## Phase 1.5 — seat the Claims Committee + rehearse

- Grant `CLAIMS_COMMITTEE_ROLE` to `COMMITTEE_SAFE` through a timelocked op (schedule from the
  protocol Safe → wait `MIN_DELAY` → execute). Revoke the old single-key committee.
- Rehearse one full timelocked op end-to-end (e.g. a no-op `grantRole`) to prove the Safe →
  schedule → delay → execute path works on the live generation. This is the gate before Phase 2.

## Phase 2 — deployer renounces (IRREVERSIBLE)

Only after a successful rehearsal:

```bash
PROTOCOL_ROLES=0x3e961139Ea0EDA926bfE8f7bfe5022D7AA108192 \
TIMELOCK_ADDRESS=<from phase 1> \
RENOUNCE_DEPLOYER=true \
WRITE_DEPLOYMENT_JSON=false \
forge script script/GovernanceMigration.s.sol:GovernanceMigration --rpc-url base_sepolia --broadcast
```

The deployer EOA renounces OWNER_ROLE + DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE. Governance then flows
**exclusively** through the timelock (proposed by the protocol Safe). Sentinel emergency
powers remain immediate and direct (not timelocked), per design.

## Post-handover verification

- `ProtocolRoles.hasRole(OWNER_ROLE, timelock) == true`
- `ProtocolRoles.hasRole(OWNER_ROLE, deployer) == false`
- `ProtocolRoles.hasRole(CLAIMS_COMMITTEE_ROLE, committeeSafe) == true`
- A direct `grantRole` from the deployer or the Safe now reverts; only timelocked execution works.

This mirrors the rehearsed coverage in `test/governance/GovernancePhase2Rehearsal.t.sol` (7/7).
